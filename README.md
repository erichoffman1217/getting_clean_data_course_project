# getting_clean_data_course_project

This data is from an experiemente on 30 volunteers within the age of 19-48. Six activities were measured for each 
individual (walking, walking up stairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying). Each volunteer was measured

They represent Smartlab, in Genoa and Techincal Research Centre for Dependency Care and Autonomous Living at the

The zip file is also included in the repo.

Transformations
Running run_analysis.R will create the tidy_data.txt
The one transformation that occured was grouping the data by subject and activity so that
the mean of the mean and mean of the standard deviation could be calculated.
All other efforts were to properly merge and bind the data and then to change column names
to be readable.
